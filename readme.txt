This contains most of the files and code required to get create a model of current forest
suitability and eventually get a measure of forest stability as proposed by Graham et al. 2010 
Ecography. It contains the scripts written for this purpose (most of which you won't need) and 
CSV files to use as presence and absence data. What is not included (because I'm not gonna upload
a 20 Gb file) are the WorldClim 2.0 data for present day conditions and any paleoclimate data (
from PaleoClim) that you wish (see Paleoforest.html for more info on why these are needed). For my
purposes, I used LH, MH, EH, M2, LGM, but seems there are many more on PaleoClim now.
